<h3 align="center"> Assignment #0: Choose Teams </h3>

#### The Course Project

All the code/documentation contributions will go through the pull-request/review process
You cannot just email your code to your teammate and ask them to upload. 
There are two options for this project:

- Web-based application.
- CLI-based application.

We provide GitHub templates for either case; however, we strongly recommend you follow the first path, if you are willing to pick up some modern app design concepts and framework. 
You don't have to make the decision right now.

#### Assignment #0

You will be marked as a team, and all teammates will receive the same mark for assignments, with adjustments based on individual performance/contribution.
